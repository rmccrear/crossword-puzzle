    <p>
      This is a game that will let you create a crossword-puzzle name-game.
    <p>
      Enter the names of all the students in the class, one name on each line. (It will make a better crossword puzzle if the names do not contain spaces.)
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      To kick it off, put your own name first in the list with the other names following.
    </p>
    <div class="create-crossword-input-container">
      <textarea rows="15" id="create-crossword-textarea" title="crossword answer and hints input" placeholder="Alice&#10Bob&#10Cathy&#10Dan"></textarea>
      <div>
        <button id="create-button">create game</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="after-create-instructions hidden">
      <p>
        Once you create the game, it will be missing clues for the crossword puzzle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let's play a game of telephone to collect one interesting thing about each person. Since you entered your name first, you can start by following the link below. 
      </p>
      <div class="created-link-outer">
        <div class="created-link-inner">
          <a id="created-game-link"></a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        When you are finished, you will send a link to the next person. Then that person will send it on the next person after that. And so on until all the students have had a turn. Then, a crossword puzzle containing everyone's name and an interesting fact about themselves will appear. The last person will share that with the group.</p>
